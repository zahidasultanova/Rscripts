Here, I am adding R scripts that I have written for different purposes.

compress_pdf: I started by putting the script that helped me to convert large pdfs into smaller versions. This is useful for image-based pdfs. Especially if you do not want to use online tools to compress a private document.

split_odf: to split pdf into desired number of pages.
